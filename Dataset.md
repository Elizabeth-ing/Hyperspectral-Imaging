## DATASET
We used the dataset Giessen from https://zenodo.org/record/1186372#.XOoch8hKjIU.
But any dataset for hyperspectral images can be used, just make sure the path in your code is correct and you have the right ENVI files (which includes a header file (.hdr) and a data file (.raw)), otherwise, the code will not run.
